// ==========================================
//
// ushyphmax.tex -- patterns for more hyphenation pattern memory (12000+).
// Also known as ushyphen.max.
//
// Needs extended pattern memory.
// Hyphenation trie becomes 7283 with 377 ops.
//
// These patterns are based on the Hyphenation Exception Log
// published in TUGboat, Volume 10 (1989), No. 3, pp. 337-341,
// and a large number of incorrectly hyphenated words not yet published.
// If added to Liang's before the closing bracket } of \patterns,
// the patterns run errorfree as far as known at this moment.
//
// These patterns find all admissible hyphens of the words in
// the Exception Log.  ushyph2.tex is a smaller set.
//
// Please send bugs or suggestions to tex-live (at) tug.org.
//
// 2005-05-30 (karl): in the past, ushyphmax.tex was a file containing
// only the additional patterns, without the \patterns command, etc.
// This turned out not to be very useful, since in practice the TeX
// distributions need one self-contained file for a language.  Therefore,
// ushyphmax.tex now contains both the additional patterns from
// Dr. Kuiken, and the original patterns and hyphenations from Knuth's
// hyphen.tex.
//
// The Plain TeX hyphenation tables.
